This upcoming article examines the Sonnar T* FE 55mm F1.8 ZA lens paired with a Sony A7 camera. It documents my impressions of the lens, and how autofocus fits my process.

I've used this lens for two weeks. Bought it to provide a comparison between native and adapted lenses. Investigate relationship between sensor stack and unoptimized lenses.

Tested with cats!

## Ergonomics
- Lens is a bit bulky, but lightweight
- Manual focus ring works well, acceleration curve is nice
- Wish there was an aperture ring
- Have not used the lens hood, adds too much bulk

## Image quality
- It is sharp
- Artifacts in out of focus highlights, probably due to molded aspheric elements
- Out of focus areas mostly pleasant

## Focusing
- Wish it could focus closer
- Autofocus is quiet, fast and accurate in good light, hunts in low light
- Unsure how to best use autofocus yet
