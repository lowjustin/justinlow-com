Title: Kinetronics Film Cleaner

----

Text: 

My anti-static film cleaner arrived this afternoon; I tested it and it seems to work. It does give off a smell of ozone when it’s in operation though.

I’ve been spending my time scanning old rolls of film, and I’m now working on November 2003. The cleaner does come in handy—I run the strip of negatives through the brushes, and any dust that settles on it after is easily blown away.
