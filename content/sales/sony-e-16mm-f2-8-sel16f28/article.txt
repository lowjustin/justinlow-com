Asking S$170. (email: justin@justinlow.com text: Email me) if interested.

This lens gives you a 24mm (approx.) field of view on an APS-C camera. If you remove the rear shroud, you can get a slightly wider view on a full-frame camera.

Glass is clean and clear. Body shows some use marks. Manual focus ring works well, autofocus is fast and quiet. Front and rear caps are included. I've included pictures of the lens below, please refer to them to see the condition.
