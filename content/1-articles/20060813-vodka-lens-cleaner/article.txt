Excerpt: While it probably doesn’t sound a very good match, I must say that vodka is the best lens cleaner that I’ve come across.

Title: Vodka: Lens Cleaner

Text: 

I’d read about it before numerous times, but always discounted it. I had a stain on a lens that wouldn’t come off, even after using Kodak’s solution, so I decided to give the vodka a try.

Even on multi-coated optics, vodka gets them clean with no streaking or residues. Really! I’ve just tried it!

I couldn’t find the bottle of regular Absolut, so I used the Apeach flavor. It’s marked 80 proof, and I don’t see any residue. The only thing remaining is a pleasant peach smell on my fingers.

I don’t think I’ll be buying commercial lens cleaners again. Cheers!
