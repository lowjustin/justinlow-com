Asking S$250. (email: justin@justinlow.com text: Email me) if interested.

This camera is well constructed, compact, and creates beautiful pictures.

Condition is 8/10. Body barely shows any signs of use. The lens has a small scratch that will not affect pictures, it was difficult to document. All functions work well, and the battery lasts a long time.

The original box and accessories (battery, charger, cables, documents) are included, and a glass screen protector comes attached. Please see the pictures to assess the condition.
