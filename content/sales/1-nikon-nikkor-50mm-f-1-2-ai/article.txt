Asking S$550. (email: justin@justinlow.com text: Email me) if interested.

This lens makes great pictures, and gives you lots of bokeh.

Glass is clean and clear. Body barely shows any use marks. Focusing and aperture rings work well. Front and rear caps are included. I've included pictures of the lens below, please refer to them to see the condition.

I've removed the rabbit ears because my camera doesn't need it. I will reattach it upon purchase.
