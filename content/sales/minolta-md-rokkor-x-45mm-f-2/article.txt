Asking S$60. (email: justin@justinlow.com text: Email me) if interested.

This lens makes great pictures, and is very compact for a SLR lens. I've used it on my Sony A7 with an adapter.

Glass has been cleaned, slight fungus marks visible near the edges, no effect on images. Body shows some use marks. Focusing and aperture rings work well. Generic front and rear caps are included. I've included pictures of the lens below, please refer to them to see the condition.
