Sold!

I've moved to Sony E-mount, and no longer use this lens.

It works well, makes great pictures. I've included pictures of the lens below, please see that for condition.

Glass is clean and clear. Body barely shows any use marks.

Original front and rear caps are included. I can't remember if I have the box, so please assume it's not here. If you ask nicely, I can include a generic 52mm UV filter.

Please PM me or WhatsApp 90103148 if you are interested. Meet up at Pioneer MRT, or Jalan Pemimpin.

Here are the pictures, please excuse the dust on the surface.
