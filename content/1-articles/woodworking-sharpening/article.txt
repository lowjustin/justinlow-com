I would like to write a series of articles documenting my approach to woodworking. This article on sharpening shall be the first in that series.

This article will approach these topics:

- Tools to be sharpened
- Grinding and honing
- Micro-bevels
- Sharpening media
- Honing guides
- Steel types

##  Tools to be sharpened
The tools I sharpen most often are chisels and plane blades. 

They are fairly similar, with a flat face, and a bevel, and differ mainly in width. I prefer adding a slight curvature to my plane blades, while the chisels are sharpened straight across.

## Grinding and honing
In the process of sharpening, I would like to distinguish between grinding and honing. 

I would describe grinding as a rough procedure, removing a substantial amount of material, with the intent of making the step of honing easier. I currently grind my primary bevels using sandpaper that has been adhered to a glass plate (more on that later). I may consider moving to a bench grinder or wet stone grinder (e.g. a Tormek machine) in future. I typically begin grinding on 80 grit, and finish grinding with 220 grit to reduce the scratch depth.

Honing is the stage in which I put the "final" edge on the blade

## Micro-bevels



##  Sharpening media

##  Honing guides

## Steel types
